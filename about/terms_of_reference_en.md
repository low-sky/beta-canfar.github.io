### Purpose
The Canadian Advanced Network for Astronomy Research is a consortium that serves
data-intensive storage, access, and processing needs of university groups and
centers engaged in astronomy research.

To this end, CANFAR develops and operates user-facing and integrated services, 
such as:

  - Research Data Management
  - User-managed storage and cloud processing
  - Specialized visualization and analytics services • Authentication and Authorization
  - Support to researchers in adapting the system to their needs

### Mission
  - To maintain and develop services in data and computationally intensive 
  research that enable Canadian researchers and their international collaborators 
  to generate the greatest possible scientific return on Canada’s investment in 
  telescopes and computational resources.

  - To coordinate efforts and resources in multi-use applications and services
  across Canadian groups, by generating integrated grant proposals and funding
  requests that enable the combination and integration of the science
  application domain (predominantly located at the universities) and the
  technical expertise (e.g. at CADC). Such grant proposals and funding request
  would be directed to any of the Canadian agencies involved in Science,
  Innovation, Computing and Big Data, such as NSERC, CFI, Canarie or NRC.

  - Interface on behalf of the astronomy community with Compute Canada to ensure
  that services meet the astronomy domain specific needs.

  - Reduce barriers and accelerate adoption of new emerging technologies in Big
  Data and Computing in the astronomy community.
  
  - Share capabilities developed in the astronomy community with other domains.

### Membership

The consortium membership reflects the necessity of present and future
science challenges to integrate those groups and institutions that specialize
in the scientific aspects (typically at the universities and research centers
and institutes) and the groups that have developed the technical and computer
engineering expertise to respond to the needs of science programs.

Consequently the following groups are eligible for membership in the CANFAR consortium:

  - Individual university researchers and their groups
  - University centers or institutions engaged in astronomy research
  - Multi-institutional or multi-investigator collaborations, including their international partners
  - Individuals and teams from the CADC, or teams from Compute Canada, WestGrid 
  or other entities that provide computational and data resources and 
  infrastructure
